Here's an improved and more structured version of your plan. I've refined the steps, enhanced the questions for better evaluation, optimized table structures, and improved the prompt for ChatGPT token generation.

## **Enhanced Plan for the Crypto News Analysis Platform**

### **1. News Parsing & Extraction**
- Fetch news from multiple sources (NewsAPI, GDELT, RSS feeds, social media).
- Extract key elements:
  - `Title`
  - `Description`
  - `Full content (if available)`
  - `Source`
  - `Publication timestamp`
  - `Authors` (if applicable)
  - `Mentions of crypto projects, tokens, exchanges, influencers`
  
### **2. News Embedding & Topic Clustering**
- Generate embeddings using **OpenAI embeddings** (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) or **Sentence-BERT**.
- Store embeddings in a **vector database** (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).
- **Topic Matching:**
  - If a new articleâ€™s embedding is **similar** to an existing topic, link it.
  - Otherwise, create a **new topic**.

### **3. Advanced News Analysis**
Each news article is analyzed with **improved factors** to determine its potential crypto impact.

#### **Key Questions for Analysis**
| Question | Possible Answers |
|----------|----------------|
| **How trending is it now?** | Not trending / Slightly / Trending / Very trending / Viral |
| **Could this trend in the near future?** | Unlikely / Possible / Likely / Very likely |
| **Is a major crypto influencer involved?** | No / Indirectly / Yes |
| **Is a major company/exchange involved?** | No / Small / Medium / Large |
| **Does this news have regulatory impact?** | No / Mild / Strong / Game-changing |
| **Has similar news caused market moves before?** | No / Similar but weak impact / Similar and strong impact |
| **How significant is the news for crypto adoption?** | No impact / Small / Medium / Big / Huge |
| **Does it have a strong "hype factor"?** | No / Mild / Moderate / High / Extreme |
| **Does this news create an opportunity for meme tokens?** | No / Slightly / Likely / Definitely |

- Assign **numerical values** to each response for later scoring.

### **4. Scoring System**
Each analysis factor contributes to a **final score** determining how **impactful the news is for a crypto token pump.**  
- A **weighted system** ensures some factors (celebrity involvement, hype, regulatory impact) contribute more to the score.
- Use a machine-learning model (logistic regression, decision trees) to improve scoring over time.

### **5. Generating Meme Crypto Tokens**
For news that meets a **"hype threshold,"** we generate **crypto token names and symbols.**

#### **Improved Prompt for ChatGPT:**
> "Given the following crypto news:  
> **Title:** {title}  
> **Description:** {excerpt}  
> **Trending Status:** {trending_score}  
> **Influencer Involvement:** {influencer_score}  
> **Impact on Crypto Adoption:** {impact_score}  
>   
> Generate a **creative meme token name** and **symbol** inspired by the news. The token should feel viral, fun, and aligned with the crypto community.  
> Output:  
> - **Token Name:**  
> - **Symbol:**  
> - **Short 1-line slogan:**"

## **Optimized Database Schema**
### **Topics Table** (Stores unique topics)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique identifier |
| `text` | TEXT | Topic description |
| `embedding` | VECTOR | Semantic embedding for similarity searches |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | When the topic was created |

---

### **News Table** (Stores news articles)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

| `title` | TEXT | News title |
| `excerpt` | TEXT | Short description |
| `content` | TEXT | Full article content |
| `source` | TEXT | News source (URL or publisher) |
| `published_at` | TIMESTAMP | Date/time of publication |
| `topic_id` | UUID | Related topic |
| `score` | FLOAT | Computed impact score |

---

### **Analysis Table** (Stores evaluation per news)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `news_id` | UUID | Foreign key to `News` |
| `trending_now` | INT | 0-4 scale (not trending to viral) |
| `future_trend` | INT | 0-3 scale (unlikely to very likely) |
| `celebrity_involvement` | INT | 0-2 scale (no, indirect, yes) |
| `company_involvement` | INT | 0-3 scale (none to large) |
| `regulatory_impact` | INT | 0-3 scale (none to game-changing) |
| `historical_similarity` | INT | 0-2 scale (none to strong impact) |
| `crypto_adoption_impact` | INT | 0-4 scale (none to huge) |
| `hype_factor` | INT | 0-4 scale (none to extreme) |
| `meme_token_potential` | INT | 0-3 scale (none to definite) |
| `total_score` | FLOAT | Computed total score |

### **Tokens Table** (Generated meme coins)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique identifier |
| `news_id` | UUID | Related news |
| `name` | TEXT | Token name |
| `symbol` | TEXT | Token symbol |
| `slogan` | TEXT | Short marketing line |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | When it was generated |

## **Final Enhancements**
- Use **time-series analysis** to detect news trends.
- Implement **Telegram/Discord bots** to alert about high-impact news.
- Add **visual dashboards** for monitoring market movements.

### **Whatâ€™s Next?**
1. **Decide on the tech stack** (Python, PostgreSQL, FAISS, OpenAI API).
2. **Set up the news retrieval system** (scrapers, APIs).
3. **Implement embeddings & topic clustering** (vector DB).
4. **Build the analysis engine & scoring system.**
5. **Generate meme token suggestions & refine prompts.**
6. **Deploy & automate with scheduled tasks.**
